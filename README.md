# Fake-News-Prediction
In this project, we explore fake news detection using a logistic regression classifier. The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing real and fake news headlines and body text. We apply techniques like text cleaning, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization to prepare the data for effective binary classification.
